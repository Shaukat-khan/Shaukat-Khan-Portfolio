# Personal Mission:
My personal mission is to be the best coder that I can be and build things for the world that would make the world a much better and cleaner place. I want to code things that would make everyone’s live much easier and make the world we live in a better place to be in. My inspiration personally comes from Elon Musk who built tesla so people can have reliable cars and make the environed cleaner. 

# Projects:
I used data structures in a programming language to build a calculator and many other class skills which allowed me to create this project.

With some research help and looking at different styles of board games, I was able to take what I had learned in class and create a game board.

Using what I have learned up until now I create a list that ranked artists from 1 to 10 depending on the trend using a file in my code.

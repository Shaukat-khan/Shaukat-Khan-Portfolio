# Personal Mission:
From an early age I have always been intersted in developing code, making webiste or apps and making people lives easier by making futuristic desgins. My inspiration personally comes from Elon Musk who built tesla so people can have reliable cars and make the enviroment cleaner. I will be graduating from Brooklyn College in December 2021 and hopefully have a joab that makes a difference by coding. 

# [Project 1:Link to a Java Chatting Application that I developed.](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/Java-Chatting-Application.git)
I used java core, swong and socket programming to create a chatting application. In this application I had a server and client where both would text one another to communicate. Using my experience in java and a little bit of research I was able to create a project that I am proud of. 

# [Project 2:Link to a Tic-Tac-Toe game board that I created using java code.](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/Lab6.git)
With some research help and looking at different styles of board games, I was able to take what I had learned in class and create a game board. At first I had diffuculty with the computer making its own moves but after many tries, I finally came across my solution. 

# [Project 3:Link to a Calculator Project](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/CalculatorPrjct.git)
This was one of my first projects I create where I was able to use basic math funtions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Once I run the project It would ask the user to enter two numbers of their choice and than they can decide what funtions to use with both numbers.

# Personal Mission:
My personal mission is to be the best coder that I can be and build things for the world that would make the world a much better and cleaner place. I want to code things that would make everyone’s live much easier and make the world we live in a better place to be in. My inspiration personally comes from Elon Musk who built tesla so people can have reliable cars and make the enviroment cleaner. 

# [Project 1:Link to a Calculator I created using java coding.](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/CalculatorPrjct.git)
I used data structures in my java programming language to build a calculator and many other class skills which allowed me to create this project. I started off researching first on how to create calculators and found many ways and learned all of them. Eventually I started making my own calculator my way by using my knowledge that I gained from class and research.  

# [Project 2:Link to a Tic-Tac-Toe game board that I created using java coding.](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/Lab6.git)
With some research help and looking at different styles of board games, I was able to take what I had learned in class and create a game board. At first I had diffuculty with the computer making its own moves but after many tries, I finally came across my solution. 

# [Project 3:Link to a top artist on spotify.com from first place to tenth.](https://github.com/Shaukat-khan/Lab-4.git)
Using what I have learned up until now I create a list that ranked artists from 1 to 10 depending on the trend using a file in my code. Using sorting methods to sort my file from a website was a first, but with data structures I had learned the skills needed for this project.
